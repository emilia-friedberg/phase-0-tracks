# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a tool that gives you the ability to make and track changes to a given file or set of files, while keeping intact the history of those files. It is useful because it allows multiple people to work on and make changes to files simultaneously, without interfering with eachother's work. It also means that you can experiment with your code without having to worry about messing something up entirely, as you can revert back to a previous version if you make a mistake.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a file or a set of files, the "master," that you can make changes to without affecting the original. You use it to create changes, particularly additions, to a file without potentially compromising the original.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point for a git repository. A good commit message succinctly describes what changes have been made since the last save point.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is what happens when you attempt to merge two branches that have both changed the same part of a file.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A virtual private server is a "virtual machine," or private contained piece of memory, that you can use in place of a physical server. They are less expensive than physical servers, and easier to create and configure.

Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Programs run in root have the ability to make changes to all system files, whereas from a normal user account they can only make changes to your home folder. So a buggy program, run from root, could potentially wipe your hard drive.

Watching a Youtube video to begin with was a helpful, concise way to get the gist of what jQuery is and how it works. Although I had intended to just watch the introductory video, I liked it enough that I went on to watch the next two videos in the series. I felt like the articles I could find regarding when/where to use jQuery were more frequently addressing whether or not to use jQuery at all, rather than doing a helpful job of explaining when to utilize it vs when to stick with vanilla JavaScript. The jQuery site itself has a good introduction, with lots of code to run to get a feel for it, and the docs are also awesome.

	<h1> Hello world! </h1>

	<p> This is my first website, and I am <strong> very </strong> excited about that!

	<h2> Here is a list of some of the things I did today, in chronological order. </h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Taught a history lesson about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>.</li>
		<li>Tried to avoid explaining to my second-graders why Eleanor Roosevelt had the same last name as Franklin Roosevelt when she married him.</li>
		<li>Fell out of a chair and sat on the floor for a minute hoping my students would think I did it in purpose.</li>
		<li>Cried while reading <em>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes</em>.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2> Here is a list of some of the things I wanted to do today, in no particular order. </h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Sleep much later than I did.</li>
		<li>Make a Game of Thrones reference while explaining the Roosevelts' shared lineage.
		<li>Not be someone who falls out of chairs anymore.</li>
		<li>Go to the Grand Canyon and never come back.</li>
	</ul>
